```bash

- npm or yarn install

- npm run dev / yarn dev #(To start development server)
```

**FOR BACKEND DEV ENVIRONMENT SETUP**:

- Create a .env file in project root directory and add the following keys:

`

`

*Ensure development server is down if running and you have docker installed*

**THEN RUN**:

```bash
- docker-compose up -d

- npx prisma migrate dev --name sample_name #(name should match latest prisma migration as seen in prisma migrations folder in project directory)
